## Abstract

You know those memory games you played in elementary school, where the teacher would put a bunch of objects on the overhead projector, let you look for fifteen seconds, then take them all away and ask you to remember details about them? That's the general idea here, only randomly generated by node.js using the idea of a procedurally-generated city to test your recall. It's also our first project of any sort in node.

## Elements

These are the various elements that will come into play. These aren't necessarily a full list, just a spitball of things we've discussed. Probably not the best place for them in the Readme, but I want you to get an idea.

* Buildings
    + Various sizes
    + Various colors?
* Streets
    + Names
    + Lengths
    + Topography
